cll means "C Language Learning". So this `repo` only build for record C traning.

### 1. test01.c 

Only for testing

### 2. hw_01_wifiset.c

Demo board wifi function setting.

This is first C language homework from my tutor Daniel. "It is the fastest way for you to fimiler our job!" he said. 
So.... let's do this!!

According to WPA Security types. This program ganna divides in four-parts to control/set Wifi Connection of the Demo Board.
```
  1. None Mode
  2. WEP Mode
  3. WPA2 Mode
  4. MIX Mode
```

### 3. hw_02_getstate.c

After done the `hw_01_wifiset`. It can possible set the wifi connect detail. So next, I build `hw_02_getstate.c` to get the wifi connection status let user know.
